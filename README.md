# GRT
This repository concerns the propositional version of GRT planner, being implemented by Ioannis Refanidis during the years 1999-2000.

Particularly, it containts the following versions:

a) Metric GRT planner, including resource handling, that was presented in a JAIR-2001 article.
b) Multiobjective planner (MO-GRT), which was presented in an AIJ-2003 article.

The above versions are C++ versions. I am still looking to find the original prolog version of the planner (I remember having sent it to Hector G., 20 years ago).
